# Brand Promise

Keeping user information safe and secure is a top priority for us at Amethyst.
As such, we welcome the contributions of all security researchers.

# Scope

If you believe you've found a security issue in any website, service, or
software owned and/or operated by Amethyst you are required you to notify us in
accordance with responsible disclosure practices to be protected by this policy.

# How to Submit a Report

To submit a vulnerability report to Amethyst, please contact us at
[report@amethyst.live](mailto:report@amethyst.live). Your submission will be
reviewed and validated by a member of our triage team.

# Safe Harbor

Amethyst supports safe harbor for security researchers who:

- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and
  interruption or degradation of our services.
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account
  holder. If you do encounter Personally Identifiable Information (PII) contact
  us immediately, do not proceed with access, and immediately purge any local
  information.
- Provide us with a reasonable amount of time to resolve vulnerabilities prior
  to any disclosure to the public or a third-party.

We will consider activities conducted consistent with this policy to constitute
"authorized" conduct and will not pursue civil action or initiate a complaint to
law enforcement. We will help to the extent we can if legal action is initiated
by a third party against you.

Please submit a request to us before engaging in conduct that may be
inconsistent with or unaddressed by this policy.

# Preferences

- Please provide detailed reports with reproducible steps and a clearly defined
  impact.
- Submit one vulnerability per report.
- Social engineering (e.g. phishing, vishing, smishing) is prohibited.
