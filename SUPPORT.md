# Support for Amethyst

Welcome to Amethyst's suite of projects! We use CodeBerg issues for
tracking bugs and handling feature requests, so those are not the right place to
get support for our projects. Please make use of the resources below to get
support for our products.

## Discussions and Live Chatting

Still need more assistance? Reach out to us in
[our Discord Server](https://invite-to.amethyst.live/). Here we can offer more
real-time support and attempt to solve your issues faster.

## Documentation

All of our projects have automatically generated documentation based on in-line
documentation that is generated at each push to main and staging.

## Security and Official Support

All else failed you? Reach out to us at
[support@amethyst.live](mailto:support@amethyst.live) for official support, and
[report@amethyst.live](mailto:report@amethyst.live) for security related
concerns. These requests can take longer to process, but will be reviewed by the
time and appropriately responded to.
