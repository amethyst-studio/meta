### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you for more
information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information
and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following
steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using
  incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the
  project's documenation. If you are looking for support, you might want to
  check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the
  same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing
  for your bug or error in our bug trackers.
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if
  users outside of the CodeBerg community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
- Stack trace (Traceback)
- OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
- Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package
  manager, depending on what seems relevant.
- Possibly your input and the output
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older
  versions?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs
> including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public.
> Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to
> [report@amethyst.live](mailto:report@amethyst.live).

We use CodeBerg issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the
project:

- Open a new issue using the respective template.
- Explain the behavior you expect vs the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction
  steps_ that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This
  usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the
  problem and create a reduced test case that explicity replicates the behavior.

Once it's filed:

- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If
  there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the
  team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `State: Blocked`. Bugs
  with the `State: Blocked` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
  We do not want to guess and check which can potentially cause us more issues.
- If our team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked
  `State: Help Wanted`, as well as possibly other tags (such as
  `Priority: Critical`), and the issue will be left to be
  [implemented by someone like you](#your-first-code-contribution) or queued up
  in our backlog of issues that need addressed.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for
Amethyst, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing
functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the
community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the documentation carefully and find out if the functionality is already
  covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a issue search to see if the enhancement has already been suggested.
  If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's
  up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the
  merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful
  to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just
  targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as issues via the Codeberg repository.

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the
  suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many
  details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to
  see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do
  not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you
  demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related
  to.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Amethyst users. You
  may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which
  could serve as inspiration.
